**Caesar-Cypher exercise from The Odin Project**

From Wikipedia:

> In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

A simple implementation of the caesar cipher as proposed in the Ruby Programming Course from The Odin Project. It takes in a string and a shift factor and then outputs the modified string.
